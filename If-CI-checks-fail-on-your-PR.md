## Introduction

If your PR build fails, do not despair! Scroll down to the bottom of the PR thread until you see the results of the continuous integration (CI) tests that ran:

  ![Screenshot of PR CI results](images/ghciSample.png)

In the example above, the lint checks and Mypy checks have failed. Also, two checks were skipped due to the failure of one of the e2e tests. (This is because, in the event of an e2e test failure, any remaining e2e tests that are queued or currently running will be terminated and marked as "skipped.") The rest of the tests have passed.

To diagnose and fix a failing check on your PR, follow the instructions below:

1. If you see a warning that your PR has a **merge conflict**, you will need to resolve the conflict. To do this, follow the "merge from develop" instructions in  [step 5 of our PR guide](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Rules-for-making-PRs#step-5-address-review-comments-until-all-reviewers-approve). Once you push the merge commit to your feature branch on GitHub, the merge conflict message will disappear.

2. If the issue isn't a merge conflict, then there are two possibilities: your code could be wrong, or the test/check on Oppia's develop branch could be incorrect. You will need to determine which of these cases it is. Note that the test/check on Oppia's develop branch could be incorrect for two reasons:

    * Sometimes, the tests in develop may be "flaky", which means they pass sometimes and fail sometimes, even though the code has not changed. The dev workflow team is trying to reduce cases like this, though they may sometimes still happen.

    * If an incorrect PR was recently merged to develop, this could cause the tests to fail on develop. If you see this happening, please follow the [[Revert and Regression Policy|Revert-and-Regression-Policy]] so that we can revert the problematic changes as soon as possible, since the develop branch should always be passing checks.


## Figuring out whether the failure is due to your PR or an existing issue

Here are some tips for how to determine whether the failing CI check is due to your code or a problem in Oppia's develop branch:

* Always start by **looking at the failure logs**. Click on the "Details" link next to each of the failing tests to inspect their logs. Then, select the job under 'Jobs' to see the logs for that particular job.

* Next, consider whether your changes could have plausibly caused the failure. For example, if you just updated the README, then there's no way that you could have broken an E2E test. Similarly, PRs that only modify frontend files are unlikely to cause errors in the "install third-party dependencies" step. However, note that changes in one part of the code can have unintended effects in apparently unrelated code. For example, if you add an E2E test that creates an exploration with the same name as an exploration created by another E2E test, you could break that other E2E test, even if it's testing completely unrelated code.
  * If your changes could have plausibly caused the failure, see [What to do if the failure is due to your PR](#what-to-do-if-the-failure-is-due-to-your-pr), below.
  * If not, search for the error message on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues) to see whether the error has been reported before. If there's an open issue for the same error, see [What to do if the failure is due to an existing issue](#what-to-do-if-the-failure-is-due-to-an-existing-issue), below.
  * If the error isn't related to your PR and there isn't an existing issue for it, you might need to file a new issue for the failure. Before doing this, double-check your PR changes and the error logs to ensure that nothing in your PR could be causing the failure.


### What to do if the failure is due to your PR

To debug and fix the failure, always start from the errors in the CI logs. They contain useful information that can help you with debugging. You can also do the following to get more information about what is causing the error:

  * Find the command that the CI workflow uses to run the tests, and run that command on your local machine. Note that all our CI checks merge from the upstream `develop` branch before running, so you might also need to merge from `develop` locally to reproduce the failure on your machine.

  * [Run the local development server](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Mac-OS%3B-Python-3%29#running-oppia-on-a-development-server) and check that the website behaves normally, with no errors in the developer console. Often, when doing this, you will get errors in the backend server logs or the developer console which can help you figure out what is going wrong.

> [!TIP]
> When running the test locally, make sure that you are using the same command that is used in CI, with the same flags. Otherwise, you might encounter different results locally and on CI. You can double-check the command by looking at the corresponding test script in `.github/actions/workflows`, or by examining the corresponding test log on GitHub Actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Even with the same command, tests can fail on CI even if they pass locally, because the two environments are different. In such cases, the CI checks are what determines success, so you might need to "debug on CI" if you cannot reproduce the error locally. If you need to do this, it is generally a good idea to make the debugging cycle as short as possible (e.g. by temporarily deleting other workflow files so that GitHub CI only runs the test that you're interested in).

If your code is wrong, you will need to fix the error just as you would [respond to reviewer comments](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Rules-for-making-PRs#step-5-address-review-comments-until-all-reviewers-approve). You may also want to review the following documentation to help you debug:

  * If a lint check is failing, see [[Lint Checks|Lint-Checks]].
  * If a test is failing, see [[Tests|Tests]].
  * For general debugging tips, see our [[debugging guides|Debugging]].

If you are stuck, compile all your findings in a [[debugging doc|Debugging-Docs]] and open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/discussions/categories/q-a-debugging-docs) with a link to it. This will make it easier for the Oppia maintainers and other community members to give you suggestions on what to investigate next.


### What to do if the failure is due to an existing issue

1. **Document the error.**

   * If the error message you see matches a known issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues), leave a comment on that known issue that points to the failing check on your PR, to document that it is still happening. This will help the dev workflow team recognize that this issue is serious and increase its priority.

   * If the error message you see doesn't match a known issue, but you have confirmed that it's not due to your changes, please file a [CI Failure report](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage+needed%2Cbug&projects=&template=3_ci_error_template.yml&title=%5BFlake%5D%3A+) that documents the error. Additionally, if you can [[trace which PR caused the error|How-to-find-the-commit-which-introduced-a-bug]], please link to it as well so that the Oppia maintainers can [revert it](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Revert-and-Regression-Policy) if needed.

2. **Restart the failing test on your PR.**

   * If you have been added to the Oppia repository as a collaborator, you can restart the test as follows:

     * Click the "Details" link next to the test you want to restart.

       ![Screenshot of PR CI results with details link](images/prCiResults.png)

     * Click on the "Re-run all jobs" button in the upper-right.

       ![Screenshot of CI result page with link to rerun jobs](images/rerunCI.png)

   * If you don't see the button or cannot click it, you might not have the necessary permissions. In that case:

     * Leave a comment on your PR that says something like "I have investigated the flake and it is the same one as reported in issue #XXX. Here is [the comment](link) I left in that issue pointing to this PR. Please could a maintainer help restart the test?" Then, tag one of your reviewers in the comment, so that they can help restart the test for you.

     * If you don't hear back within 24 hours, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/discussions/categories/q-a-contacting-folks) to request a follow-up.

   * If the CI failure persists after 1 restart and continues to block your PR from being merged, please escalate the issue to the dev workflow team on both the issue thread and GitHub Discussions, since this is an indicator that it might start affecting other PRs.


## What to do if CI checks only fail in the merge queue

If the CI checks pass on your PR, but you see a failure in the merge queue when attempting to merge, do the following:

* Look at the error logs for the failure, and follow the instructions above in [What to do if the failure is due to an existing issue](#what-to-do-if-the-failure-is-due-to-an-existing-issue) to document the flake.

* Once you have documented the flake, ask the maintainers to help force-merge your PR. Note that this will only be granted if the above step is followed (i.e. the PR conversation log should include evidence that the merge-queue error is indeed a flake, and the occurrence should be reported in the corresponding issue thread).
